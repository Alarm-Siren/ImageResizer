## Usage Instructions

### Output Quality
Note to Self: Quality; Low = Bicubic, Medium = Bilinear, High = HQ Bicubic, Ultra = HQ Bilinear

## Build Instructions

The application is built using Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2012 for Windows Desktop.
There are no special dependencies: the Visual Studio project is already configured to build the application correctly (in either Debug or Release configuration).
The installer is built using Inno Setup 5.5.9. Again, there are no special dependencies: the Inno Setup script is already pre-configured to correctly build an installer for the *release* version of the application.
